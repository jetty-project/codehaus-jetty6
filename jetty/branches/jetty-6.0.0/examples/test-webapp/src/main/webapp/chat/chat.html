<h1>Jetty AJAX Chat</h1>
Three really important things about this chat room demo:<ul>
<li>It has really HORRID Styling.  Please feel free to donate a pretty css :-)</li>
<li>It is written using AJAX techniques provided by
<a href="http://bennolan.com/behaviour/">Behaviour</a> and
<a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>.</li>
<li>It uses Jetty6 <a href="/javadoc/org/mortbay/util/ajax/Continuation.html">Continuations</a>. No are used when waiting for async
events (see below).
</li>
</ul>


<div id="chatroom">
 <div id="chat"></div><div id="members"></div>
 <div id="input">
   <div id="join" >
     Username:&nbsp;<input id="username" type="text"/><input id="joinB" class="button" type="submit" name="join" value="Join"/>
   </div>
   <div id="joined" class="hidden">
     Chat:&nbsp;<input id="phrase" type="text"></input>
     <input id="sendB" class="button" type="submit" name="join" value="Send"/>
     <input id="leaveB" class="button" type="submit" name="join" value="Leave"/>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>

 <h3>How this works</h3>
 This chat room is put together with html, javascript and a filter as follows:
 <ul>
 <li><p>The chat.html file provides the basic layout for the page, including this text and a bunch of
 <code>div</code> elements that define the layout of the chat room.  This html will render well
 without any javascript etc.</p></li>

 <li><p>The chat.html file includes the default.js file, which simply includes
 javascript libraries of
<a href="http://bennolan.com/behaviour/">Behaviour</a> and
<a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>.</p></li>

 <li><p>The chat.html file includes the chat.js script which is the client side smarts of the chat room:</p>
 <ul>
         <li><p>Using Behaviour, the DOM model of chat.html is enhanced with onclick and onkeypress functions
         to trigger the dynamic interations.</p>
         </li>
         <li><p>Using Prototype, the URLs for the AJAX requests for <code>join</code>,
         <code>leave</code>, <code>chat</code> and <code>getEvents</code> are defined.
         </p></li>
         <li><p>Using Prototype, event handling objects are created to handle membership, events and polling for events.</p></li>
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li><p>On the sever side, the ChatFilter is instantiated to filter requests to chat.html:</p>
    <ul>
            <li><p>The ChatFilter extends AjaxFilter, which identifies requests that are AJAX requests and
            gives assistance with formatting the AJAX responses.  All other requests are passed normally.
            </p></li>

            <li><p>The ChatFilter provides methods for join, leave, chat and getEvents.  Most of these are
            fairly straight forward and just manipulatet state and send the appopriate AJAX response.</p></li>

            <li><p>The smarts are in the getEvents method.  This method is a poll from the client for any
            events on the server for the given member.   If there were no events and the server simply
            replied with an empty response, this poll would become a busy poll and consume CPU on both
            client and server.</p>

            <p>
            To avoid this, normal AJAX servers will simply wait for a short period (eg. 30 seconds).
            If an event occurs in this time, the response is sent immediately. If the period times out,
            then an empty response is sent.  Either way the client will then poll again for more events.
            </p>

            <p>
            But for servlets, this waiting for events, is done in the request handler, when a thread has
            been allocated.  Thus it makes it very difficult to scale an AJAX server to thousands of users
            as you will need thousands of threads - mostly idle waiting for events.
            </p>

            <p>
            Thus Jetty 6 introduces <a href="/javadoc/org/mortbay/jetty/util/Continuation.html">Continuations</a>, which allows the handling of a servlet request to
            be suspended until either a timeout occurs or an asynchronous event calls resume on the
            continuation.  This allows threadless waiting and thus permits an AJAX server to scale without
            consuming vaste numbers of threads.
            </p>
            </li>

    </ul>
