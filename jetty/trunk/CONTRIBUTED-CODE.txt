All code is contributed and committed by the folks with licenses in the LICENSES-tmp directory.

Some patches are contributed by users via JIRA @ http:/jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY

Those patches are reviewed and mostly modified substantially by the committer.

The fundamental things for review that are different then what has already passed muster are:

* all source not in the jetty-util and jetty directories
* items noted in the EXTERNAL-DEPENDENCIES.txt file, though most are likely already approved
** servlet -3 libraries with sun headers, worked on by greg wilkens which are still at The Codehaus
** asm libraries for annotation scanning.
** mail and jta libraries are new
** jaas libraries are new
** geronimo dependencies will likely be need to be approved
** activation libraries
