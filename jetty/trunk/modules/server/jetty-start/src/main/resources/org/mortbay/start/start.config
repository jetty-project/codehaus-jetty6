# This file controls what file are to be put on classpath or command line.
#
# Format is as follows:
# Each line contains entry for one JAR file.
# Format of line:
#
#  SUBJECT [ [!] CONDITION [AND|OR] ]*
# 
# where SUBJECT: 
#   ends with ".class" is the Main class to run.
#   ends with ".xml" is a configuration file for the command line
#   ends with "/" is a directory from which to add all jar and zip files. 
#   ends with "/*" is a directory from which to add all unconsidered jar and zip files.
#   ends with "/**" is a directory from which to recursively add all unconsidered jar and zip files.
#   Containing = are used to assign system properties.
#   all other subjects are treated as files to be added to the classpath.
#
# Subjects may include system properties with $(propertyname) syntax. 
#
# Files starting with "/" are considered absolute, all others are relative to
# the home directory.
#
# CONDITION is one of:
#   always
#   never
#   available classname        # true if class on classpath
#   property name              # true if set
#   exists file                # true if file/dir exists
#   java OPERATOR version      # java version compared to literal
#   nargs OPERATOR number      # number of command line args compared to literal
#   OPERATOR := one of "<",">","<=",">=","==","!="
#
# CONTITIONS can be combined with AND OR or !, with AND being the assume
# operator for a list of CONDITIONS.
# Classpath operations are evaluated on the fly, so once a class or jar is
# added to the classpath, subsequent available conditions will see that class.
