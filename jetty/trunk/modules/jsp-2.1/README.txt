The jesper module is based on the jasper code from the apache tomcat project.
It is not intended to be a fork of that projects code base, but rather 
a variant.   A patch set will be maintained and regularly the code will
be refreshed from the apache svn repository and the patched updated and 
applied.  Eventually it is hoped this will be automated in maven.

The intent of the patches are:

  0) to fix any problems not yet fixed in apache svn 
  1) to remove JCL
