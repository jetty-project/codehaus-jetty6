       <h2><a href="http://www.mortbay.com/MB/log/gregw/?permalink=ScalingConnections.html">Scaling Connections for AJAX with Jetty 6</a></h2>
       <div>
Jetty 6 employs a number of innovative strategies to ensure that only the resources that are actually required are assigned to a connection and only for the duration of they are needed. This careful resource management gives Jetty an architecture designed to scale to meet the needs of AJAX applications.

<span>Jetty</span> is an open-source, standards-based, full-featured web server implemented in java. It is released under the Apache 2.0 licence and is therefore free for commercial use and distribution. 
</p>
<p>
First created in 1995, Jetty has benefitted both from input from a vast user community and consistent and focussed development by a stable core of lead developers. 
</p>
<p>
Jetty can be used as:
<ul>
  <li>a stand-alone traditional web server for static and dynamic content</li>
  <li>a dynamic content server behind a dedicated HTTP server such as Apache using mod_proxy</li>
  <li>an embedded component within a java application</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This flexibility means that Jetty can be encountered in a number of different contexts:  
 <ul>
  <li>shipped with products to provide out-of-the-box useability eg  <a href="http://tapestry.sourceforge.net">Tapestry</a>, <a href="http://www.liferay.com/">Liferay</a></li>
  <li>distributed on CDs with books to make examples and exercises ready-to-run</li>
  <li>incorporated into applications as a HTTP transport eg <a href="http://www.jxta.org/">JXTA</a>, <a href="http://www.mx4j.org">MX4J</a></li>
  <li>integrated as a web container in J2EE app servers eg <a href="http://www.objectweb.org/jonas/index.html">JOnAS</a>, <a href="http://geronimo.apache.org">Geronimo</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss//">JBoss</a>, <a href="http://www.huihoo.org/jfox">JFox</a></li>
  <li>included as a component of an application eg <a href="http://maven.apache.org/continuum">Continuum</a>, <a href="http://www.cenqua.com/fisheye">FishEye</a>, <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a></li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
There are many more examples of Jetty in action on the  <a href="http://www.mortbay.com/mortbay/powered.html">Jetty Powered Page</a>. However, as Jetty aims to be as unobtrusive as possible, many websites and products are based around Jetty, but Jetty is invisible!
</p>
<p>
Some of the defining features of Jetty are:
</p>
<div class="feature">
<h2>Simplicity</h2>
The guiding principle of Jetty could be said to be "simplicity not complexity". We want to make Jetty easy to understand and use: 
<ul>
  <li>Configuration is either by API or by xml file</li>
  <li>Xml file syntax is a straightforward mapping from the API operating on POJOs</li>
  <li>Default configuration files make Jetty useable out-of-the-box</li>
  <li>Minimal number of lines required to embed a Jetty instance</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="feature">
<h2>Efficiency</h2>
A lot of effort goes into optimizing Jetty's performance and crafting the code so as to make the footprint as small as possible:
<ul>
<li>Dependencies are kept to the absolute minimum</li>
<li>The core is kept small with extra functionality in optional jars</li>
<li>Scalability is a key concern</li>
<li>Performance degrades gracefully under stress</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="feature">
<h2>Embeddability</h2>
Jetty is designed to be a good component. This means that it can easily be embedded in an application without forcing the application to adapt to it:
  <ul>
    <li>Usage of dependency injection and inversion of control patterns</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="feature">
<h2>Pluggability</h2>
Jetty is architected for pluggability. The API allows different implementations of all of the principal Jetty components to be selected. At least one, but sometimes more, implementations of a component are always provided. However if these do not meet your needs, you are free to code your own using the interfaces and abstract classes as a basis. This means that Jetty can be easily customised to a particular application environment. This is particularly useful when Jetty is acting as the web container in a J2EE server, as Jetty's pluggability ensures a tight integration with a host container.
